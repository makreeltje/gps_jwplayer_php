<v >What?

00:13:07 --> 00:13:10
<v >That I said where the medicines were.

<v >Where? - Here, just below my floating rib, but ...

00:13:33 --> 00:13:34
<v >Wait...

00:13:35 --> 00:13:37
<v >One may not be enough.

<v >Again.

00:25:56 --> 00:25:59
<v >Jardani ...

00:25:59 --> 00:26:01
<v >Why did you come home?

00:26:06 --> 00:26:09
<v >You pretend that is an answer.

00:26:09 --> 00:26:11
<v >I still have my ticket.

00:26:12 --> 00:26:18
<v >Do you think that&#39;s still valid after all the chaos you&#39;ve caused?

00:26:18 --> 00:26:22
<v >The Ruska Roma is committed to the High Table ...

00:26:22 --> 00:26:25
<v >and it transcends everything.

00:26:25 --> 00:26:29
<v >It is already suicide that I talk to you.

00:26:29 --> 00:26:34
<v >You testify me by knocking on my door with knock.

00:26:36 --> 00:26:39
<v >Oh, Jardani ...

00:26:39 --> 00:26:41
<v >What has become of you?

00:26:43 --> 00:26:46
<v >I am Jardani Jovonovich.

00:26:48 --> 00:26:51
<v >I am a son of Belarus ...

00:26:51 --> 00:26:55
<v >an orphan from your tribe.

00:26:55 --> 00:26:58
<v >You have a duty to help me.

00:26:58 --> 00:27:03
<v >It is your duty and my right.

00:27:07 --> 00:27:09
<v >Rooney, enough.

00:27:18 --> 00:27:20
<v >Come with me.

00:27:41 --> 00:27:43
<v >Right ... You are not entitled to anything.

00:27:44 --> 00:27:50
<v >When my people came here, they wanted nothing but a life without suffering.

00:27:50 --> 00:27:55
<v >I tried to get those childish ideas out of their heads, but then again ...

00:27:56 --> 00:27:57
<v >art is pain.

00:28:01 --> 00:28:03
<v >Life is suffering.

00:28:08 --> 00:28:11
<v >You managed to escape.

00:28:11 --> 00:28:14
<v >But now you are back to square one.

00:28:14 --> 00:28:16
<v >And what was it all about?

00:28:17 --> 00:28:20
<v >To a puppy?

00:28:21 --> 00:28:25
<v >It was not just any puppy.

00:28:37 --> 00:28:41
<v >Do beautiful memories emerge?

00:29:02 --> 00:29:03
<v >Sit down.

00:29:17 --> 00:29:19
<v >If I wanted to ...

00:29:19 --> 00:29:22
<v >I can&#39;t help you, Jardani.

00:29:22 --> 00:29:25
<v >The High Table wants your head.

00:29:25 --> 00:29:28
<v >How can you fight the wind?

00:29:28 --> 00:29:32
<v >How do you destroy the mountains, how do you bury the ocean?

00:29:32 --> 00:29:38
<v >How to get out of the light You can find the darkness ...

00:29:38 --> 00:29:40
<v >but they are also in the darkness.

00:29:42 --> 00:29:44
<v >So tell me, Jardani.

00:29:45 --> 00:29:48
<v >What do you really want?

00:29:50 --> 00:29:52
<v >Passage.

00:29:53 --> 00:29:55
<v >Where would you like to go then?

00:29:56 --> 00:29:58
<v >Casablanca.

00:30:00 --> 00:30:04
<v >The road to paradise starts in hell.

00:30:08 --> 00:30:11
<v >All right, you give me your ticket ...

00:30:12 --> 00:30:14
<v >and I make a crack in it ...

00:30:15 --> 00:30:17
<v >if you really want to.

00:30:56 --> 00:31:00
<v >With this, Jardani, your ticket is torn.

00:31:09 --> 00:31:12
<v >You can never come home again.

00:31:14 --> 00:31:17
<v >Take him to the lifeboat.

00:31:54 --> 00:31:57
<v >Welcome to the Continental. Can I help you?

00:32:15 --> 00:32:17
<v >Sir ...

00:32:17 --> 00:32:21
<v >there is an arbitrator here for you.

00:32:22 --> 00:32:24
<v >Excellent, sir.

00:32:26 --> 00:32:28
<v >The manager is in the salon.

00:32:33 --> 00:32:37
<v >I assume you&#39;re here in connection with John Wick?

00:32:37 --> 00:32:39
<v >Then we can keep it short.

00:32:40 --> 00:32:45
<v >I told him to leave, he refused and the stocking is finished.

00:32:45 --> 00:32:49
<v >Mr. Wick broke the rules.

00:32:49 --> 00:32:52
<v >And I have no idea where ... You are mistaken.

00:32:52 --> 00:32:57
<v >I&#39;m here because Mr. Wickde broke rules at this hotel.

00:32:57 --> 00:33:02
<v >Blood was spilled in the Continental&#39;s building, right?

00:33:02 --> 00:33:06
<v >The body itself is cooling down within these walls.

00:33:06 --> 00:33:09
<v >I would like to see it.

00:33:36 --> 00:33:39
<v >Santino D&#39;Antonio.

00:33:39 --> 00:33:41
<v >New Member of the High Table ...

00:33:41 --> 00:33:46
<v >killed by Mr. Wick while taking refuge in the Continental.

00:33:49 --> 00:33:52
<v >With a .45 ACP, it seems.

00:33:53 --> 00:33:59
<v >I can&#39;t control Mr. Wick&#39;s actions. But he&#39;s still alive because you see fit.

00:34:01 --> 00:34:06
<v >You&#39;ve known Mr. Wick for many years. One could call yourself friends, right?

00:34:06 --> 00:34:09
<v >Instead of killing him ...

00:34:09 --> 00:34:13
<v >let him escape after he killed Santino D&#39;Antonio.

00:34:13 --> 00:34:18
<v >I made it an excommunicado. - An hour ahead.

00:34:18 --> 00:34:22
<v >He was in violation of my hotel. Exactly, your hotel.

00:34:22 --> 00:34:25
<v >Where does your loyalty lie?

00:34:25 --> 00:34:27
<v >I have 40 years of service.

00:34:27 --> 00:34:31
<v >In the service of the Table, everything is done under the Table.

00:34:31 --> 00:34:38
<v >I cannot condone this, but please note that I am here to judge you.

00:34:38 --> 00:34:42
<v >You have a week to complete your affairs.

00:34:42 --> 00:34:46
<v >Your successor will then be appointed.

00:34:47 --> 00:34:50
<v >Rules apply.Only that distinguishes us ...

00:34:50 --> 00:34:52
<v >Of the animals.

00:34:52 --> 00:34:55
<v >You have seven days.

00:34:58 --> 00:35:04
<v >If you need help with the transition, I&#39;m in room 217.

00:35:04 --> 00:35:08
<v >A pleasant stay at the Continental.

00:35:20 --> 00:35:23
<v >There is an arbitrator for you.

00:35:37 --> 00:35:40
<v >Welcome to my nerve center.

00:35:40 --> 00:35:47
<v >The brain stem of my organization, from where I manage the flow of information.

00:35:47 --> 00:35:51
<v >With pigeons.- Yes, you see flying rats ...

00:35:51 --> 00:35:54
<v >but I see the internet.

00:35:54 --> 00:35:56
<v >Without IP addresses.

00:35:56 --> 00:36:02
<v >No digital footprint. Not to be followed, not to be hacked, not to be traced.

00:36:02 --> 00:36:04
<v >Can you get diseases from it?

00:36:04 --> 00:36:07
<v >I wouldn&#39;t eat them.

00:36:07 --> 00:36:10
<v >What do you want?

00:36:10 --> 00:36:14
<v >I want to see where it didn&#39;t happen. What not?
